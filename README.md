# Breakout


This is my first Python Opengl game. 

### Game levels
The game has three levels. Each level has more tiles than the previous, the paddle gets smaller and faster and the ball travels faster as well.

### Player lives
The player has three lives throughout the three levels. The player loses a life if the ball goes below the paddle.

### Win or lose
If the player finishes all the levels, the game stops and a green box is displayed.
If the player loses all his lives, the game is lost and a red box is displayed.
